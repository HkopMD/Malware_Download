I did NOT create the ransomware samples ending with ".exe".

Disclaimer
The purpose of this repository is to provide easy access of ransomware samples to researchers.

I recommend you to execute these in a Virtual Machine like https://www.virtualbox.org/ with restricted access to the internet & networks, 

if you have no experience or knowledge in running ransomware safely then i do not recommend you run these.

Remember these are live and will infect your machine OR other machines as well as encrypting files (some of which can't be decrypted) if you do not execute them safely
